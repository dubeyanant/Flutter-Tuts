Dart is a type-safe general-purpose programming language designed for building fast apps on multiple platforms.

Just-In-Time compilation helps developers boost their productivity with features like hot reload.

Type safe is a variable whose value always matches its static type, which results in fewer runtime errors.

Dart also provides dynamic types and runtime checks. It also provides null safety.

A Dart program always starts with a void main(). Everything in Dart is an object except null.
